              University of Technology Sydney, Australia</strong
            >. Currently, I have received an offer from The University of Hong
            Kong for a master's degree. I will be going to Hong Kong to pursue
            my master's degree in September 2022.

            I am being in gap year, but I am working on finding an internship
            job for the rest of my gap year. This purpose of builing this
            website is to practice my frontend skills, meanwhile, it is also a
            kind of personal blog that could keep some precise and importnant
            moments in my daily life.

            I was at a mainland Chinese university from 2016 to 2017, however, I
            did not like where I was. Everything around me was aweful and
            hopeless. Therefore, I decided to decline my enrollment at that
            university. After that, I studied IELTS very hard to meet the entry
            requirement listed in UTS conditional offer. In 2018, I went to UTS
            to restart my bachelor studies and wanted to get myself back to the
            position where I used to be.

          <i>
            As I said before, I will go to Hong Kong for further education in
            September 2022 at The University of Hong Kong. I am pretty excited
            with the upcoming studies at HKU, as this will provide me with so
            many opportunities to meet new people. After completion of the
            master's degree at HKU, I would love to return to Australia for PhD,
            having a PhD is what I always want, to be honest.
