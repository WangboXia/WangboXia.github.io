          Hello, I am Wangbo Xia, who completed my bachelor's degree at
          University of Technology Sydney, Australia. Currently, I have received
          an offer from The University of Hong Kong for a master's degree. I
          will be going to Hong Kong to pursue my master's degree in September
          2022.
        </p>
        <h3>Current Me</h3>
        <p>
          I am being in gap year, but I am working on finding an internship job
          for the rest of my gap year. This purpose of builing this website is
          to practice my frontend skills, meanwhile, it is also a kind of
          personal blog that could keep some precise and importnant moments in
          my daily life.

        <p>Waht I have done in the past few years</p>
        <p>I was at a mainland Chinese university from 2016 to 2017, however, I did not like where I was. Everything around me was aweful and hopeless. Therefore, I decided to decline my enrollment 
          at that university. After that, I studied IELTS very hard to meet the entry requirement listed in UTS conditional offer. In 2018, I went to UTS to restart my bachelor studies and wanted to 
          get myself back to the position where I used to be. 
        </p>

        <p>What I am gping to do in upcoming years</p>
        <p>As I said before, I will go to Hong Kong for further education in September 2022 at The University of Hong Kong. I am pretty excited with the upcoming studies at HKU, as 
          this will provide me with so many opportunities to meet new people. After completion of the master's degree at HKU, I would love to return to Australia for PhD, having a PhD
          is what I always want, to be honest.
